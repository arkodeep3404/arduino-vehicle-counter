# Arduino Vehicle Counter

![Vehicle Counter](vehicle_counter/work3.png)

Monitor traffic with style using the Arduino Vehicle Counter. This project leverages an infrared sensor and an LCD screen to accurately count passing vehicles. Whether for traffic analysis, data-driven insights, or fun experimentation, this sleek device showcases the synergy of hardware and software.

## Features

- Accurate vehicle counting using an infrared sensor.
- Real-time display of the vehicle count on an LCD screen.
- Simple and efficient Arduino code for easy customization.
- Seamless integration of hardware components for a clean design.
- Potential for further expansion and integration with other systems.

## Setup

1. Connect the infrared sensor and LCD screen to your Arduino board.
2. Upload the provided Arduino code to your board using the Arduino IDE.
3. Watch the vehicle count increase as vehicles pass by the sensor.

## Usage

1. Place the sensor strategically to monitor vehicle movement.
2. Monitor the real-time vehicle count displayed on the LCD screen.
3. Analyze traffic patterns, gather data, or use it for experimental purposes.
